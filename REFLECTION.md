Design Choices and Project Goals:

When starting this project, I had a few clear goals in mind:

- Compile the file in a single pass.
- Use efficient data structures.
- Write clean and efficient code.
- Enjoy the process!

**Did I achieve the goals I set for myself?**

- Single-Pass Assembler: I believe I achieved this goal. While I’m certain there are more efficient ways to implement it, I'm content with the results, especially given that this was my first attempt.

- Efficient Data Structures: I feel confident that I used efficient structures where it mattered most, such as in the symbol table and directive references. I also avoided overcomplicating things where simpler structures sufficed.

- Clean and Efficient Code: This is an area where I see room for improvement. I could have avoided hardcoded text and magic numbers, and I also wish I had written the hash table implementation in a more generalized form. I initially planned to add a linker, but I ultimately decided against it. So while I made progress, I feel this goal wasn’t entirely met.

- Check! :)

**What Would I Have Done Differently?**

Besides the points mentioned above, my biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of careful planning and structuring before writing any code. I lost valuable time refactoring and restructuring on the fly—issues that could have been avoided with better initial planning. This would have freed up more time to implement complex features.

Overall, despite its many flaws, I view this project as a success. The lessons I’ve learned here give me more confidence as I approach future projects. Each project is a stepping stone to more complex challenges, and I’m excited about what’s next.

Thanks,
